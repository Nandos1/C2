You are running your fingers through her hair. She doesn't really know you yet, so she's not totally relaxed yet. You have just gone through almost this entire conversation with her, pretty much verbatim, but it didn't work out the way you wanted it to. Now what? </p>

      <p class="text-left">Stuff like this went on for a while. Because she was still a bit nervous, she was going into interrogator mode and asking me the same questions that I'd already asked her. The dialogues in this book are based on actual conversations that I've had, and they're pretty close to the actual dialogues that took place. I tried to make them a little more interesting by adding in some jokes, but when people are nervous or if they don't know you very well, they may ask the same questions over and over again because at first their brain can't process much information. Until they feel comfortable with you, it's not uncommon for them to repeat the same questions over and over again in different ways, or to tell you about themselves in a very repetitive way because it's just easier for them.

      <p class="text-left">An interesting conversation is a process that involves a lot of back and forth between the two of you. If one person is doing all the talking, then you're not having a conversation. If she's answering your questions in a monotone voice, then again, it's not really a conversation because she's just telling you something without really interacting with you.

       <div class="container">
      <p class="text-left">Allowing her to talk using her own words is an important part of holding an interesting conversation with a woman. It's what allows her to open up and feel comfortable around you. Most guys have trouble doing this because they don't realize how important it is for them to allow a woman to be herself. They try too hard to impress girls by giving them answers instead of asking their questions and listening to what she has to say. When they aren't talking, girls think that the men are bored or that they find them boring or stupid, or that they think that the men are smarter than they are because </p>
